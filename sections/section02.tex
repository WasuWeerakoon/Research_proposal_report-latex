\section{Literature Review}

First, give a small introduction to the section.

Arrange your related literature in Thematic or Chronological approach. Better to follow Thematic approach.

Summarize what was found and clearly identify the gap your research will fill - this will be a separate sub-section and the last section

Use citations appropriately. 

Here is an example reference using Harvard style: \citep{ref1}.\\

Also, you can use it in this way as well: \citet{ref1} stated that ...\\

Let's assume a research study titled 'A Reinforcement Learning Approach for Phishing Detection.' If a thematic approach is used, the following themes can be considered, and these will serve as the sub-sections of this section.

\subsection{Overview of Phishing Attacks}
\subsection{Traditional Phishing Detection Techniques}
\subsection{Machine Learning Approaches for Phishing Detection}
\subsection{Reinforcement Learning in Cybersecurity}
\subsection{Gaps in the Existing Literature}
